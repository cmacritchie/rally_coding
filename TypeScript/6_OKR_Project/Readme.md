# Typescript Book-Library project

This is a small fullstack Typescript capestone project which was created for learning purposes. It uses the following technology

- node.js
- mongodb
- react
- Typescript

The purpose of this project was to learn Typescript and create a full-stack application for logging OKRs (Objective, Key, Results). This is a simple CRUD application, and is meant purely for developing my understanding of Typescript. To begin the application:

1. in mongoose.ts file adjust the connection string to match the address of your mongodb database.
1. in the server folder run `npm install` to install server dependencies
1. run `npm run start` to run the project server
1. in a separate command line, run `tsc -w` to run typescript in watch mode and compile if you wish to make changes to the code
1. the backend server is running locally on port 5000
1. in the front_end folder run `npm install` to install client dependencies
1. in the client folder, run `npm run start` to run the client side server
1. in a separate command line run `tsc -w` to run typescript in watch mode if you plan on making changes to the code.

Now the project is up and running; go to http://localhost:3000/#/ to view the application.

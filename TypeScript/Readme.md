# Typescript Rally coding
A number of practice excercises I used to learn Typescript. Many of these excercises were learned or used in [Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller's Typescript Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/understanding-typescript/).
I put together a capestone project called [OKR_PROJECT](https://github.com/cmacritchie/rally_coding/tree/master/TypeScript/6_OKR_Project) using everything I learned.
